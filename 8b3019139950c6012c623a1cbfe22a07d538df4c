      "message": "(\"pseudo\" reference from TST mtg) Charts: voltha, voltha-stack and voltha-infra are all dependent, updated whenever individual components (ONOS, VOLTHA) are updated.\n\nNice answer when updating charts is to modify all files and versions within a single patch.  Not creating a single patch wades into a version/dependency rabbit hole.\n\nAdd to this updating copyright notices, this will increase the patch file count to 92 files -- which is a bit much to request in a code review.\n\nInstead the mega patch was broken apart and submitted for each individual repository.  As chart patches are merged in each of the yet-to-be-upgraded chart patches pull in the last-merged-version of {voltha,stack,infra}.  Then increment the chart version again for the next chart/repository submitted.\n\nWhile this patch was waiting/dependent, two other chart patches were merged in.  To submit the patch needed to first merge with HEAD to be current (pull in 2 chart bumps) then increment voltha-infra version a 3rd time for the current patch.\n\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, would have been far easier to submit a single helm chart patch if deployVolthaStack and onos had not failed on timeout.",
