      "message": "Should add a local README.md or README.jager.md to document why the conditional tag/version handling was needed -- in addition to the commit message.\n\nIf tag handling was incorrect for the Jager container was it due to a bug in the tracing system ?\n  o If yes should the conditional be revisited later to revert (open a jira ticket as a reminder) ?\n  o Or is a distinct version/image tag explicitly needed and the image tag should persist ?\n\napiVersion bumps look ok",

      "message": "I think there is a misunderstanding here. The previous code was just hardcoding \"1.18\" as the value for \"tag:\", meaning the value set in the Chart.yaml for \"appVersion\" (which was also \"1.18\") was not used at all. This patch now copy pastes the same logic used in all other charts to actually read out the value of \"appVersion\" and set is as value for the \"tag:\" (instead of using the previously hardcoded value).",
