      "message": "After checking the related patch here:\n\nhttps://gerrit.opencord.org/c/voltha-go-controller/+/34824/3/docker/Dockerfile.voltha-go-controller#b52\n\nIt looks like the linked line above removed the CMD without a replacement. The commit message does not explain why this was needed, so i assume this was done by accident. My suggestion here would be to add the correct CMD to launch the voltha-go-controller application to the Dockerfile (as a replacement for the removed script) instead of passing it here as an argument.",
